This app can be used to generate a logo for developers that want a simple logo to cut costs, especially if freelancing. The user will open a command-line, run the app using node index.js. The user will be prompted for text and can enter up to three characters. They can choose a text color from a prompt, by entering a color keword or  a hexadecimal number. They will choose a shape from a list that they can then enter a color for by entering a color keword or  a hexadecimal number.When all the prompts are answered, an SVG file is created in the examples folder and a message appears to confirm the logo has been created. When the user opens the svg file in a browser they are presented with a 300x200 pixel image that matches their choices.
